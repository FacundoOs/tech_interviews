We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then written code to make them pass. Why?
We avoid writing unnecessary code
Greater peace of mind. By following the TDD process, you know that by the end of the job, the code will be pure, clear and clean.
Refactoring. We do not have to wait for the code to be completed to be able to carry out this task, but the code is rewritten as errors are detected.
Depuration. TDD is the best way to detect faults.
Agile development. A continuous flow of tasks, analysis and corrections is what defines the agile methodology. TDD has all the requirements to be one.
Customer satisfaction. At all times, the tests are designed from the customer's point of view, therefore the product will be totally focused on their satisfaction.
